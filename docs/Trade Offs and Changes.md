# Trade Offs and Changes

## Designing Project Structure
### One Stage vs Two Stage Application
- When I was planning my dashboard site, I needed to figure out the architecture so I could move forward. I had two ideas:
  - Monolithic application
  - Services-based application (I seperate the application into an 'app' and a pipeline, deploying both seperately and connecting them)
    #### Option A: App indirectly connects to the pipeline
      - Pipeline ingests data from Kaggle
      - Pipeline computes analysis (preprocessing, etc)
      - Pipeline sends analysis to DB
      - 'App' connects to DB, rendering data
    #### Option B: App directly connects to the pipeline
      - Pipeline ingests data from Kaggle
      - Pipeline computes analysis (preprocessing, etc)
      - Pipeline sends analysis to DB
      - 'App' requests DB info from Pipeline service, rendering data

Result: I chose designing a service-based application based on option A. After doing some research, I realized that option A was better because it increases the amount of abstraction between them. This abstraction is, I believe makes option A closer to real world workflows.


## Choosing Technologies



### Web App Design
Finally, I have designing my dashboard as a web app. I had two options:
  - Streamlit
    - Simple to use
    - Very limited (Difficult to interact with html directly)
  - Dash
    - More Complicated
    - Customizable

Choosing between using Streamlit and Dash was one of toughest choices I had to make for this project. In fact, I was originally planning on using streamlit since my architecture design makes my web app need to render my analysis instead of processing it. 

So there wasn't much difference between the two. However, as I was developing, I realized that streamlit's more limited web design tools actually made it difficult to design. So I decided switching to Dash would be better long term.


### Designing in Plotly Dash
Something I've realized is the subtle difference between using Plotly Dash vs HTML/CSS. For the most part its similar, you still write with CSS rules and HTML elements with Python as an intermediary. However, since Dash has its own ways of handling web design, I had to take a step back from designing and focus on understanding Dash. Methods I would have quickly applied like page wrapping (for min-width clamps), or patterns for absolute-relative elements wouldn't work as easily as they did.


## ACT Analysis

### ACT 1
#### Calculating Annual Revenue
Since there was no direct column for revenue, I had to calculate it by cross-referencing my orders ('olist_orders_dataset.csv) with my transactions ('olist_order_payments_dataset.csv), aggregating them to get an approximate result. 

In order to do this though, I would need to preprocess my order timestamps, converting them from string to DateTime. However, this posed a new challenge, which order timestamp should I use for my analysis? Initially, I was planning on using order_purchase_timestamp, but since multiple transactions exist for a given order (paying in installments), I wasn't sure using it would give me an accurate result. Also, transaction records have no timetamp directly associated, so I can't traverse them to find the last transaction date for approximation.

In the end, my best option was to use the order_delivered_customer_date since that was the date has most likely chance of everything being resolved.
